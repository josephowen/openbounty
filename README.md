Hackathon project for BitCamp Spring 2014.

## Summary
Have you ever thought that you would totally give a dollar or two to get someone to do something? This could be something silly like walking an obstacle course blindfolded, or it could be something truly helpful like cleaning up a public park. Open Bounty is a website that lets people microfinance great and silly ideas. When you propose a bounty like this, you automatically pledge a dollar. People who think your idea is a good one can also put a dollar towards it. If someone decides that they will take on your challenge, they can provide proof of their action, and be rewarded with the pooled dollars of all the sponsoring individuals.
